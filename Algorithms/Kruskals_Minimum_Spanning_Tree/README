MINIMUM SPANNING TREE

The subset of edges that connects all vertices in the graph, and has minimum total weight.

Kruskal(V,E)

A = empty
foreach v in V:
    Make-disjoint-set(v)
Sort E by weight increasingly
foreach(v1,v2) in E:
    if Find(v1) != Find(v2):
        A = A union {(v1,v2)}
        Union(v1,v2)
return A
